## Known Issues
OpenAI's Whisper model can only work with audio files that are 30 seconds long.
To circumvent this issue, the audio recording and file will be split into 30-second chunks if they are longer than 30 seconds and will be processed that way by the Whisper Model.
However, this can lead to mistakes when words get cut into two different audio files.
